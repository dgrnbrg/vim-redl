You need Clojure runtime (vim-clojure-static) plugin and vim-fireplace + vim-classpath plugins to use this plugin.

CLOJURE CONFIGURATION                      *redl-clojure-configuration*

Add following lines to your ~/.lein/profiles.clj

:injections [(require '[redl core complete])] ensure that redl is loaded on jvm startup
:dependencies [[redl "0.1.0"]] ensures that redl is available on the classpath

A minimal profiles.clj (including REDL, Spyscope, and lein pprint) would look like:

{:user {:dependencies [[spyscope "0.1.2"]
                       [redl "0.1.0"]]
        :injections [(require 'spyscope.core)
                     (require '[redl complete core])]
        :plugins [[lein-pprint "1.1.1"]]}}

REPL                                       *redl-repl*

Repl is only available in Clojure filetype.

                                           *redl-:Repl*
:Repl                   Show repl in user namespace.

                                           *redl-:ReplHere*
:ReplHere               Show repl in current namespace.

                                           *redl-CTRL-e*
C-e                     Evaluate current line in instert mode, regardless of
                        cursor position.

                                           *redl-CR*
CR                      In insert mode at the end of the line evaluates the line, otherwise inserts a newline.

                                           *redl-CTRL-UP*
C-Up                    Goes up in the repl history.

                                           *redl-CTRL-DOWN*
C-Down                  Goes down in the repl history.

OMNICOMPLETE                               *redl-omnicomplete*

This feature requires redl to be loaded in the connected JVM, as this plugin
uses redl's advanced fuzzy completion engine.

KEYS                                       *redl-keys*

To change default keys you can use following plugs:

<Plug>clj_repl_enter.    CR
<Plug>clj_repl_eval.     C-e
<Plug>clj_repl_hat.      ^
<Plug>clj_repl_Ins.      I
<Plug>clj_repl_uphist.   C-Up
<Plug>clj_repl_downhist. C-Down
